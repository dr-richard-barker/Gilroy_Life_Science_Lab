Astronauts Scott Kelly, Kjell Lindgren, and Kimiya Yui all munched on red romaine lettuce this afternoon, except unlike your sad desk salad, this produce was grown on the International Space Station. It was the first time people have eaten food cultivated in space. Aug 10, 2015 the birth of the first ever Space-Farmers. Video courtesy of UW-Madison.

### Introduction

Plants play a pivotal role in the sustainability of isolated and extraterrestrial environments by recycling water, air, and food through natural processes. In a groundbreaking collaboration, National Geographic and the University of Arizona's biodome project introduce "SIMOC," a sophisticated space habitat farming and atmospheric modeling tool. This innovative platform allows users to design and simulate their own space agroecosystem, fostering a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in maintaining life-supporting habitats in space. Explore and model your space habitat by following the link provided.

### Importance of Plants in BLSS

* **Oxygen Production:** Essential for converting CO2 into oxygen in closed habitats.
* **Carbon Dioxide Removal:** Helps maintain gas balance and prevent toxic CO2 levels.
* **Water Recycling:** Allows water reuse through plant transpiration.
* **Food Production:** Provides renewable, nutritious food sources.
* **Psychological Benefits:** Enhances well-being and reduces stress in confined spaces.

### Challenges in Implementing Plants in BLSS

* **Environmental Control:** Requires complex, energy-intensive maintenance of optimal growth conditions.
* **Space Constraints:** Maximizing yield within limited space is challenging.
* **Resource Utilization:** Precise management of water and nutrients is crucial.
* **Crop Selection:** Selecting high-yielding, nutritious, space-efficient plants is essential.
