This tool is designed for the exploration of natural variation within environmental contexts, utilizing a genetic mapping approach that leverages natural diversity to examine the genetic mechanisms underlying plant responses to gravitropic stimuli. Gravitropism is among the most constant and significant biological cues, fundamentally influencing plant architecture and productivity through the process known as gravimorphogenesis. Current research has identified the loci of gravity perception in plants to specific tissues and elucidated key components of the gravi-response pathway, including auxin transport mechanisms. Despite these advances, a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular processes underpinning gravity and touch perception, and their integration into localized growth regulation, remains elusive. To address this gap, our research employs a synergistic methodology encompassing molecular genetics, cellular imaging, and morphometric kinematic analysis. This approach aims to delineate Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways in relation to growth responses in both wild-type specimens and mutants with alterations in hormone and growth pathways of _Arabidopsis_. Notably, _Arabidopsis_ thrives in diverse environmental settings globally, enriching our study with a broad spectrum of natural variation.

Quantitative trait locus analysis of the _Arabidopsis_ genome identifies regions that contain genes involved in gravity perception and response. The red and blue heatmap shows regions that are positively or negatively correlated with the speed of reorientation. _Arabidopsis_ has 5 chromosomes. The higher the LOD score in that region of a chromosome, the higher the probably that genes found there are involved in the trait being measured.
