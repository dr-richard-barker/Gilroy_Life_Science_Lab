The timeline of information related to the Bio-Plex Bioregenerative Life Support System from the image is as follows:

* **1991-1993**
  * Project started with initial funding for labor and construction of a new building (B241) including chambers.
  * Personnel moved from B241 to B29.
  * Chambers were moved from B241 to B29 rotunda.
  * An interconnecting tunnel was installed in B29 rotunda.
  * Four chambers were connected to the interconnecting tunnel.
* **1994**
  * Design and testing continued on subsystems and components.
  * Initial outfitting of one chamber for plant growth began.
  * A prototype plant growth rack was built and installed in the chamber.
* **1995**
  * Prototype rack buildup continued.
* **1996**
  * Specifications were developed for two new chambers.
  * Design concepts began for a plant growth chamber (BPC 1) and other systems including air, water, solid waste, and thermal.
* **1997**
  * Funding increased for annual funding and construction of facilities.
  * Construction modifications began on the rotunda in B29.
  * Ventilation system installation began.
  * Design continued on BPC 1, new chambers, and air and water systems.
  * Advanced automation and controls (ER) and food systems, human factors (SF) were incorporated into the design.
* **1998**
  * Funding increased for annual funding.
  * Construction modifications of the rotunda in B29 were completed.
  * Two new chambers (BPC 1 and HAB) were purchased.
  * Specifying of the interconnecting tunnel began.
  * Design continued on BPC, including testing of lighting systems.
  * Initial habitation chamber layout evaluation began.
  * Design continued on air, water, and thermal systems.
* **1999**
  * Annual funding increased.
  * Preliminary design reviews (PDRs) were held for various systems.
  * Installation of facility systems began including lighting, power, cooling, and ventilation.
  * Investments were made in advanced controls and food systems and human factors.
* **2000**
  * Annual funding increased.
  * Non-advocate peer review was performed.
  * Design and system development continued.
  * Flooring, drains, lighting, and emergency systems were installed.
* **2001**
  * Annual funding significantly decreased.
  * Project shutdown was directed in April.
  * Stand down for 18 months to focus resources on ISS was planned.
  * Annual funding remained at a low level for R\&D hardware development.
* **2002 and beyond**
  * No direct BIO-Plex activity.
  * Remaining funding was used for R\&D hardware development.

**Late 2000s**

* BIO-Plex Facility was scrapped to make room for the CEV Avionics Laboratory
