# There is natural diversity in sensitivity to salt (NaCl)

Choi et al. (2014) discovered a novel mechanism through which plants integrate their responses to localized salt stress across different parts, involving Ca2+ wave systems. This system allows for the rapid transmission of stress signals from the roots, where salt is detected, to distant parts of the plant, facilitating a coherent molecular response. The propagation of these Ca2+ waves underscores a critical pathway for the instant communication of salt stress within plants, highlighting the natural variation in salt sensitivity and the advanced physiological tactics plants employ to manage environmental stressors.
