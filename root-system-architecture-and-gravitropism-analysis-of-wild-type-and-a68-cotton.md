# Root system architecture and gravitropism analysis of wild type and A68 cotton



ABSTRACT

Previous work has shown that plants sense gravity and guide their growth with respect to the gravity vector in a process called gravitropism. Transgenic lines of the same species can have different sensitivities to gravity, which affects the growth of the root system. An analysis of a plant’s root system architecture gives insight into its growth pattern and nutrient uptake. The root system can be manipulated to optimize water and nutrient uptake and promote more efficient growth. The purpose of our research is to determine how cotton that is over-expressing a vacuolar proton transporter (AVP1, the tonoplast proton/pyrophosphatase) differs from wild type cotton in its root system and response to gravity. To successfully grow cotton in a microgravity environment, an in-depth understanding of cotton’s response to gravity is vital. We collected root angle measurements with RootNav software to determine the root’s response to gravity over time. It was determined that the gravitropic response of the transgenic line is faster than wild type. Therefore, A68 is more sensitive to changes in gravity and may be more sensitive to other environmental changes.

INTRODUCTION

The history of the study of space biology is marked with expanding the knowledge of plant growth systems. Early spaceflight experiments found that the ability to manipulate gravity was a useful tool in studying development and plant orientation (Halstead and Dutcher, 1987). Hypotheses in the early 1990’s proposed that plants respond to all mechanical forces, including gravity, via similar cellular mechanisms. Therefore, the weightless space environment influences plant growth in a way that may expand past the gravitropism response.

Plants sense gravity and guide their growth with respect to the gravity vector in a process called gravitropism (reviewed by Baldwin et. al, 2013). Roots grow at gravitropic set angles, and yet can be environmentally and physiologically adapted (Digby and Firn, 2002). In a microgravity environment, like space flight on the international space station, the ability of plants to use gravity as a signaling to help coordinate growth is clearly affected. Gravitropism interacts with other tropisms, such as phototropism, hydrotropism, chemotropism, and thigmotropism, to affect growth and development. Therefore, plants grown in microgravity are likely to have altered responses to their environmental cues, which may manifest as alterations to root growth patterns leading to changes in root system architecture and modifications to the plants aerial structure. Gravitropism has also been shown to influence gene expression (reviewed by Baldwin et al., 2013). Therefore, plants grown in space with altered gravitropism responses express different genes than expressed on earth.

&#x20;Several experiments have studied the transcriptome response of plants from space-grown plants and compared them with ground controls (Paul, 2005; Salmi and Roux, 2008, Correll, et. al, 2013). Such experiments conclude that spaceflight samples have genes altered in their expression by often more than 4-fold. Some genes, most notably genes for photosynthesis, were over expressed when exposed to the space environment. Some heat shock genes were over expressed by 10-fold in comparison to a ground control. A DNA microarray analysis of Arabidopsis seedlings and cell cultures suggests that spaceflight can have a dramatic impact on the expression of genes (Paul, 2012). Understanding the role of gravity during plant growth and development is essential in order for us to reliably grow crops in space as part of a bioregenerative life support system.

&#x20;An indicator of crop productivity is the plant’s root system architecture (RSA). RSA is defined as the spatial configuration of the root system (Lynch, 1995). Root systems are incredibly varied among species and even between two plants of the same genotype. Although different, the root systems reveal important patterns encoded by the plants’ genes and are influenced by the plants’ environment. The influence of RSA on crop productivity stems from the fact that nutrients are unevenly distributed in soil. If a plant’s roots can branch laterally or grow deeper in the soil, it has a better chance of absorbing more water. Root architecture is also linked with water acquisition and nutrients that move with water. It is possible to manipulate the RSA to prevent abiotic stresses that may negatively impact the growth of the plant (de Dorlodot, 2007). A study on root growth in high and low nutrient environments suggests that root angle may affect field yield and drought tolerance (Atkinson et. al, 2015).

Cotton is an important crop that supports millions of farmers globally and drives the international economy. In the United States alone, the cotton industry accounts for more than $21 billion in products and services annually, which generates more than 125,000 jobs from farming to textile milling (USDA, 2018). India dominates cotton production and exportation with textiles and clothing exports valued at $36.8 billion (India Brand Equity Foundation, 2017). Cotton itself is highly susceptible to drought stress. Therefore, learning about its growth and development with the goal of improving water use efficiency and seedling development, even in stressful environments, would have a major impact on a key crop. Research on cotton growth, marker assisted breeding and genetic engineering efforts have created stress resilient variants that are capable of growing in marginal agroecosystems. This has increasing relevance with current water shortages, crop yield with a growing population, and the rise of atmospheric CO2. &#x20;



The current literature suggests that a cotton line overexpressing AVP1 has more biomass compared to the wild type. AVP1 is the single gene that encodes for the vacuolar transporter H+-pyrophosphatase (Sarafian, 1992). Vacuolar transporters enable plants to interact to changing environmental conditions, by storing nutrients and maintaining metabolic conditions in the cytosol (Martinoia, 2006). H+-pyrophosphatase increases proton pump activity, acidifying the vacuole. Sodium-proton antiporters pump protons out and sodium ions in, leading to sequestration of sodium and detoxification of the vacuole. The Na+ gradient across the membrane creates an action potential allowing for greater control of water movement into the vacuole. The gradient may make the plant more sensitive to environmental signals, like abiotic stressors. Additionally, water accumulation in the vacuole induces high turgor pressure, which drives plant cell growth (Majda, 2018). Increased water accumulation from the high concentration of sodium ions in the vacuole may explain why AVP1 overexpression cotton has increased biomass.

\
My research will seek to better understand the differences in growth and development between wild type cotton and an AVP-ox line known as A68. The genetically engineered cotton may have a different sensitivity to gravity in comparison to the wild cotton due to the role of auxin during gravitropism. The growth response of plants to gravity is regulated by an asymmetric distribution of auxin (Aloni, 2006). Auxin promotes acidification of the apoplast to loosen cell walls and, thus, promote growth (Majda, 2018). In addition to regulating vacuolar pH, AVP1 also influences auxin transport and auxin-dependent growth, such as gravitropism response (Li, 2005). If the transgenic line has an altered gravitropic response, the mutation may also alter growth, development, and nutrient uptake. A gravitropism assay and root system architecture analysis will help determine the productivity of the different lines (Lynch, 1995). We expect that the gravitropic growth vector of transgenic line will be significantly different from the wild type growth vector. The altered sensitivity to gravity may alter the root growth angle and may, therefore, change the roots’ depth and access to water.

\


METHODS

After genetically modifying an organism, it is important to thoroughly characterize how the transgene is influencing the GMO. This can be done by comparing how the transgenic line compares to the wild type plants in a range of different environments. A68 is a genetically modified version of wild type cotton. To understand how the transgenic insert affects the transgenic cotton’s growth, shape, and nutrient uptake, we will compare its root system to wild type cotton. To measure gravity sensitivity, we will conduct a gravitropism assay comparing wild type and A68 cotton. Sensitivity to gravity will be measured in tip angle from vertical and analyzed with RootNav software. If A68 has a different growth vector from wild type cotton, it may be more sensitive to gravity due to a perturbed gravity response system.

&#x20;

Sterilizing and Imbibing Cotton

10 wild type and A68 cotton seeds were placed in two empty 50 mL Falcon plastic-capped centrifuge tubes. To sterilize, about 15 mL of 15M sulphuric acid was poured over the seeds. The seeds were allowed to soak in the acid for two minutes. In a biosafety cabinet, the sulphuric acid was poured out of the Falcon tubes. Autoclaved water was repeatedly poured into the Falcon tubes and then poured off five times for each tube. After the fifth rinse, each tube was filled with 15 mL of autoclaved water and left on a shaker for 48 hours. We conducted this procedure for four biological replicates.

&#x20;

Gravitropism Assay

After 48 hours, the seeds were removed from the shaker. For each seed that had germinated, a circular Petri dish was obtained. About 15 layers of circular filter paper were placed in each Petri dish. Then, excess water in the Falcon tubes was poured off into a waste container. A germinated seed was placed and taped on the filter paper so that the radical was laying on the paper. The petri dish was then parafilmed and labelled accordingly. This same procedure was followed for each germinated seed. The Petri dishes were then placed into the Gilroy lab custom FlashLapse photography system. The custom FlashLapse software was then used to record JPG photos at selected intervals.&#x20;

&#x20;

Root System Architecture Analysis

After 24 hours, the images were enhanced using imageJ software for RootNav analysis and compiled into a time-lapse video. For better analysis, the clarity of each image was raised to 100 and cropped to only show the seed and the root. RootNav analysis was performed to measure root angle for both the wild type and A68 images. We analyzed root angle for images at intervals of approximately four hours from 0-24 hours, resulting in 6 analyzed images. These root angle measurements were compiled in a MS Excel spreadsheet. All biological replicates for wild type were combined into a mean root angle for each time measurement. A mean was also calculated for all A68 replicates. The mean root angles for wild type and A68 were graphed in a time versus root angle line graph. A paired t-test was run comparing the WT and A68 means to determine significant difference.

&#x20;

Dry Weight Measurement

Wild type and A68 were grown in soil, extracted, and rinsed. The roots and shoots were scanned to conduct root system architecture analysis. Once dried, the roots were weighed to obtain dry weight measurements. The average dry weight was calculated. A paired t-test comparing the A68 average and WT average was run to determine significant difference.

&#x20;

RESULTS

Via RootNav, the mean root angle was calculated for images collected at hours 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 23.5. The data was sorted by removing outliers and normalizing the starting root angle to 90.&#x20;

After removing outlier values from Figure 1, the mean root angles were normalized to a starting root angle of 90. The mean root angles at each time point are graphed in Figure 2. To test for significance, a paired t-test was run comparing the normalized mean at each time period of wild type and A68. The normalized means and the calculated p values are displayed in Table 1.&#x20;

Dry weight for two wild type and two A68 plants was measured. The average dry weight for wild type was 0.16055 g, and the average dry weight for A68 was 0.4097 g.&#x20;

A paired t-test was also run for the dry weight measurements. In testing the two A68 measurements and the two wild type measurements, the p value calculated was 0.0459041868.&#x20;

\
Our results show that at four out of five time periods, A68 cotton responds to gravity in a significantly different way in comparison to wild type cotton. The gravitropic response of the transgenic line is significantly faster ( p<0.05) than wild type and overshoots the vertical (0 degrees). Therefore, A68 is more sensitive to changes in gravity and may be more sensitive to other environmental changes. A68 also had a higher dry weight, suggesting a more extensive root system and longer roots. Gravitropic orientation seems to play a critical role in these plants that plays out as altered patterns of exploration of the soil and so to altered stress resilience.&#x20;



**DISCUSSION**

Our results show that A68 responds to gravity significantly faster than the wild type. This altered sensitivity to gravity seems to play a critical role in plant growth and development. For example, the AVP1 overexpression line has a longer root system and a larger dry weight compared to the wild type (Pasapula, 2011). The role of auxin in controlling root growth is well-developed. It’s possible that proteins can control root system architecture by creating a gravity-induced auxin gradient (Yoshihara, 2017; Band, 2012). Greater acidification of the vacuole could explain the increased growth of the AVP1 overexpressing cotton. The larger root system allows transgenic cotton to absorb water more efficiently under drought and saline conditions, resulting in stress tolerance and increased yields. This is likely to be one factor that is contributing to the stress tolerance and increased cotton yields reported by Papsula, et al. in 2011. Since the AVP1 overexpression line allows for greater control of water movement, utilization of transgenic cotton could improve crop yield and drought tolerance in arid and semiarid areas of the world

The link between the overexpression of the vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase and salinity and drought resistance is well researched. Research has concluded that transgenic plants expressing higher levels of the vacuolar proton-pumping pyrophosphatase, AVP1, are more resistant to salt and drought than are wild-type plants (Gaxiola, 2001; Pasapula, 2010). The enhancement of crop yield is consistent across plant species, evident in Arabidopsis thaliana, tomato, rice plants, and barley. Improving crop yield to prevent food scarcity is especially relevant with increasing population growth and climate change. For example, growing transgenic barley expressing AVP1 is a promising option for increasing cereal crop productivity (Schilling, 2014). Our research, confirming that transgenic cotton has altered growth and biomass, supports these conclusions.



Preliminary research revealing that cotton expressing AVP1 has altered gravity sensitivity and a more extensive root system was based on gravitropism assays and dry weight measurements. In developing protocols for growth of cotton on the International Space Station (ISS), some limitations exist. On the ISS, the cotton will be grown in the Vegetable Production System (VEGGIE). The VEGGIE has a customized LED light system with red, blue, and green lights (Zabel, 2016). The growth system is separated from the rest of the cabin, allowing for containment and increased humidity.&#x20;

\
To test cotton’s water needs, a water gradient experiment was run. However, since water movement in space is completely different than on earth, protocol for watering on orbit will change. There is also different lighting in the VEGGIE growth system. We have tried to replicate the VEGGIE lighting in growth chambers, but it may not be the exact wavelength as used on the ISS. Our preliminary data narrows down the range of treatments that need to be investigated at the Kennedy Space Center in their VEGGIE growth system.



In running the gravitropism assays, low-level green light was used to minimize phototropic response. Plants have blue light receptors and red light receptors that regulate the movement of auxin to position the plant towards a light source (Fankhauser, 2015). To mitigate this, low-level green light was used. However, some of the green light may have overlapped in the blue light spectrum, which could cause a phototropic response. This may alter the plant’s reorientation kinetics. To obtain dry weight measurements, cotton was grown in soil. Water distribution is uneven throughout the soil. This alters the plant’s access to water. The transgenic AVP1 expressing cotton may have had greater access to water, which allowed for greater root development.&#x20;

\


In analyzing root reorientation angle with RootNav, there was a concern with potential biases. Knowledge of the genotype, wild type versus transgenic, going into the analysis can skew results. There is implicit bias in analyzing data hypothesized to be significantly different. Aware of this possibility, we conducted double blind testing in our root system analysis by examining an image without the genotype and add adding it after analysis.

\
Separating gravity-driven development from other confounding variables that affect plant growth is not possible in current ground-based experiments. To reveal the true gravity-based developmental differences between wild type and transgenic cotton, future experiments must be conducted on the International Space Station. We have obtained a grant from CASIS and Target in coordination with NASA to send cotton into space on the ISS. Our future research goals are to further understand the links between root system architecture and gravity and to identify new genes involved in drought, osmotic and salt stress.&#x20;



Our proposed research plan is to grow the cotton on foam inside sterile plastic boxes called “magenta cubes.” After sterilizing the seeds with chlorine gas and sowing the seeds in the magenta cubes, the plants will launch into space and dock at the ISS. The sample will be loaded into the VEGGIE growth system, and then water will be injected into the bottom of the cubes to begin germination. When the plants germinate, the roots will grow down along the side of the foam, receiving water from the foam. The magenta box system will allow the astronauts to photograph the seedling’s growth over time. After growth on the ISS, tissue samples will be stored into RNAlater solution to protect the RNA. Once returned to earth and to our lab, we will extract the RNA and run analyses to determine genes involved in abiotic stress responses.

Our research suggests that A68 has a larger root system contributing to nutrient and water absorption. We have also demonstrated that the transgenic cotton responds faster to gravity. With altered sensitivity to gravity, transgenic cotton may have different responses to other tropisms as well. The extent of this tropic sensitivity is relatively unresearched. In future, the FlashLapse software could be used to test for an altered phototropic response by investigating the roots’ sensitivity to blue and red light. Understanding the link between gravitropic response and root system architecture could improve crop yield, even in drought and saline conditions. Since earth is expected to have 9 billion people by 2050, salinity and drought are the major productivity limiting factors. Failure to increase the productivity of the current agro-ecosystem and improve the efficiency of its distribution will lead to more virgin ecosystems being brought into cultivation.

\


The precise details of root system architecture distribution of transgenic AVP1 expression lines has not been studied. By testing gravitropic responses, this experiment revealed developmental differences between the overexpression and wild type lines. Previously, the effect of gravity on transgenic and wild type cotton was unknown. The results of this study show that AVP1 overexpression in transgenic cotton could prove useful for increasing crop productivity in drought and saline conditions. Our future research will help determine exactly how the root system architecture is affected by the lack of gravity and what genes are involved in cotton growth under abiotic stress.
