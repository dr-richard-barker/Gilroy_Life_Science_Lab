Astronauts Scott Kelly, Kjell Lindgren, and Kimiya Yui all munched on red romaine lettuce this afternoon, except unlike your sad desk salad, this produce was grown on the International Space Station. It was the first time people have eaten food cultivated in space. Aug 10, 2015 the birth of the first ever Space-Farmers. Video courtesy of UW-Madison.

### Introduction

Plants are crucial in bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS) for sustainable living in isolated environments and space missions, recycling water, air, and food through biological processes.

### Importance of Plants in BLSS

* **Oxygen Production:** Essential for converting CO2 into oxygen in closed habitats.
* **Carbon Dioxide Removal:** Helps maintain gas balance and prevent toxic CO2 levels.
* **Water Recycling:** Allows water reuse through plant transpiration.
* **Food Production:** Provides renewable, nutritious food sources.
* **Psychological Benefits:** Enhances well-being and reduces stress in confined spaces.

### Challenges in Implementing Plants in BLSS

* **Environmental Control:** Requires complex, energy-intensive maintenance of optimal growth conditions.
* **Space Constraints:** Maximizing yield within limited space is challenging.
* **Resource Utilization:** Precise management of water and nutrients is crucial.
* **Crop Selection:** Selecting high-yielding, nutritious, space-efficient plants is essential.

We've been working with NASA GeneLab and [Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium to make life science data accessible to teachers and citizen scientists](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fspacebiology.carthage.edu%2Fgrade-6-12-educators\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw1oAHRsf8VsXWklQu3ATS0-). This work was made possible by collaborators at the NSF CyVerse Cloud Computing infrastructure, the JPL interplanetary protection team, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and Qlik. The AstroBotany team's international presence has grown linking researchers, educators and students in the US, Japan and the UK. Our goal is to use the excitement of space exploration to train the next generation of citizen scientist to tackle any challenges that may arise in the future.
