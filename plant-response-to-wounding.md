# Plant response to wounding

Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of glutamate-like receptors within certain biological systems, indicating that their activation can be achieved through the administration of glutamate (Toyota et al., 2019). It has been observed that calcium waves traverse through plants, forming a fundamental component of the systemic stress signaling mechanism.
