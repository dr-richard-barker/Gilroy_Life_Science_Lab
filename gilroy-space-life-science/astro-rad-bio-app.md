# Astro-Rad-Bio-App

[Rad-Bio-App: a discovery environment for biologists to explore spaceflight-related radiation exposuresIn addition to microgravity, spaceflight simultaneously exposes biology to a suite of other stimuli. For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceflight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight.](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41526-021-00143-x\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw1jEZZWqAU6qvoFVb9iMxng)

**Disclaimer:** Absorbed doses are in water based on a standard conversion from dose in silicon.

Doses include approximate dose received on launch vehicle before transfer to the ISS.  Since there was no dosimetry on the launch vehicle, dose is approximated based on average values in the US Lab.&#x20;

Doses are from preliminary analysis of data from  instruments on the International Space Station, analyzed by subject matter experts from the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), NASA-JSC ([https://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/](https://srag.jsc.nasa.gov/)).&#x20;

For more detailed data, contact SRAG, through GeneLab ([https://genelab.nasa.gov/help/contact](https://genelab.nasa.gov/help/contact)).

“As this app relies upon these preliminary analyses by members of the SRAG deposited and curated at GeneLab website, use of the data is subject to the following requirements:”

• Data for internal NASA use or for use by NASA-funded or outside investigators are to be obtained directly from the GLDS ([https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation](https://genelab.nasa.gov/environmental/radiation))

• Use of the data in publications or presentations shall require:&#x20;

&#x20;    – Consultation with SRAG for data integrity and interpretation.

&#x20;    – Acknowledgement of one or more subject matter experts from SRAG.

## Van Allen Radiation Belts surround Earth. <a href="#h.p_loxruiflxeev_l" id="h.p_loxruiflxeev_l"></a>

When life leaves to the Earth's surface to explore low earth orbit, the moon and mars it leaves the protection of the Earth's magnetosphere. The area that surrounds the earth that has increase amounts of radiation are known as the Van Allen Belts. A Van Allen radiation belt is a zone of [energetic](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEnergy\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2EVU5e66Kc96H3CLFZ2t1X) [charged particles](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCharged\_particle\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2jb2v17LtIDv5GtQWumA\_p), most of which originate from the [solar wind](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSolar\_wind\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw0RKvCf0EfayPpp9WoiI6-X), that are captured by and held around a planet by that planet's [magnetic field](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEarth%2527s\_magnetic\_field\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2yql75OoMDU-JsqLHJ\_7af).

## The South Atlantic Anomaly <a href="#h.p_om8voakty2h8_l" id="h.p_om8voakty2h8_l"></a>

The South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) is an area where the Earth's inner [Van Allen radiation belt](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FVan\_Allen\_radiation\_belt\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw3WfmHQJs\_7uj9z2-C7YPT5) comes closest to the [Earth](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEarth\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw1oKqC482rn-6MTJW-s9GNy)'s surface, dipping down to an altitude of 200 kilometers (120 mi). This leads to an increased [flux](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFlux\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2vk4xZ91eEknkv7Nfp6QnY) of energetic particles in this region and exposes orbiting [satellites](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSatellite\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2qhrSIyPzJwKGr\_J\_PplN8) and the International Space Station to higher-than-usual levels of radiation.

The effect is caused by the [non-concentricity](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FConcentric\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw1i1OzuI0TX2A\_qyHFQlAro) of the Earth and its magnetic [dipole](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDipole\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw30QViIJLuaKoGYEFACFBjq). The SAA is the near-Earth region where the [Earth's magnetic field](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEarth%2527s\_magnetic\_field\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw2yql75OoMDU-JsqLHJ\_7af) is weakest relative to an idealized Earth-centered dipole field.

## How does a linear accelerator work? <a href="#h.p_6vlg9xjhalit_l" id="h.p_6vlg9xjhalit_l"></a>

There are many different types off terrestrial forms that can be generated from a range off different sources. Linear accelerators are one mechanism humans use to generate radiation in order to change biological systems.
