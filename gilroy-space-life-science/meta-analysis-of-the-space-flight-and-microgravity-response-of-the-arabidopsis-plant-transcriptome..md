### Abstract <a href="#abs1" id="abs1"></a>

This study investigates how plants react to the unique conditions of space by analyzing the expression of genes in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ during spaceflight. Data from 15 spaceflight experiments available in NASAâ€™s GeneLab were re-examined using a unified computational pipeline, enhancing the reliability of comparisons between different datasets.

Key Findings:

* Plant responses to spaceflight are influenced by numerous factors, including altered gravity, hardware environment, and increased radiation.
* A common analytical approach for both microarray and RNA-seq datasets reveals significant variations in gene expression when compared to earthbound controls.
* The study underscores the importance of considering the type of analysis, environmental conditions, and hardware used when interpreting the impact of spaceflight on plant biology.
* By leveraging a meticulously curated metadata matrix, it is possible to isolate studies with similar experimental designs, thereby mitigating confounding variables in cross-experiment comparisons.

This research emphasizes the complex nature of space bioeffects on plants and highlights the necessity for standardized methodologies in the comparative analysis of spaceflight experiments.

This meta-data exploration tool is designed to allow you to examine the curated meta-data associated with the spaceflight-related experiment. Examine the different factors that may contribute to the gene expression patterns presented in TOAST4.5. We have used the [NASA GeneLab](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgenelab.nasa.gov%2F\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw0k2UGekyiJOpd6vOEW70dK) recorded factors as guides then mined the literature and interviewed the scientists who executed the experiments in order to find links between the experiments with the GeneLab repository.
