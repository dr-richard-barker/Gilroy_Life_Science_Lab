# Gilroy Life Science Lab

### The Gilroy "Collaboratory" Research Focus <a href="#h.p_wrqhnrjjsssj" id="h.p_wrqhnrjjsssj"></a>

### Gilroy Lab <a href="#h.p_v7t3ys7dlrhf_l" id="h.p_v7t3ys7dlrhf_l"></a>

We are interested in how plants sense and respond to their environment and how these signals regulate plant development. The research emphasis of the lab is to try and understand these processes at the cellular level. We combine advanced microscopy approaches such as confocal microscopy with biochemistry and molecular biology to address a wide range of biological questions:

*
  1. How do plants sense and respond to abiotic stresses?
  2. How do roots and shoots sense and respond to gravity and touch stimuli?
  3. How do plants regulate growth?
  4. How do plants respond to the spaceflight environment?

### Targeting Improved Cotton through Orbital Cultivation (TIC-TOC) <a href="#h.9esm31cu8j2t_l" id="h.9esm31cu8j2t_l"></a>

## TIC-TOC Mission: Launching New Horizons in Plant Science

The TIC-TOC launch took place aboard the SpaceX Dragon during its 22nd Crew Resupply Mission to the International Space Station (ISS). The focus of the TIC-TOC mission is a pioneering technology demonstration involving GMO AVP-OX. This innovative approach aims to uncover novel mechanisms for enhancing plant resistance to two significant stress factors: drought and salinity. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for advancing our agricultural practices and ensuring food security in the face of changing environmental conditions.

Plants are subjected to a wide array of stresses throughout their lifecycle, including but not limited to mechanical injuries, attacks by herbivores, microbial infections, extreme temperatures, inadequate or excessive water, atmospheric gases, uneven light exposure, and ionizing radiation. These stress factors can severely impact plant growth, development, and yield.

The GMO AVP-OX technology holds the potential to revolutionize our approach to managing plant stress, particularly by mitigating the effects of drought and salinity. If successful, this demonstration could pave the way for developing crops that are more resilient to these stressors, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability in an increasingly challenging global environment.



### APEX5: can we engineer plants that don't feel "pain"? <a href="#h.p_t-qfrspgtkaq_l" id="h.p_t-qfrspgtkaq_l"></a>

The Gilroy lab uses molecular analysis of _Arabidopsis_ plants with altered genes to in order to investigate their function. A combination of a plant's environment and genetics creates what we call the plant's "phenotype". Some genes make plants more sensitive to environmental stress and others make plants more resilient. The TOAST database allows citizen scientists to find genes that respond to spaceflight, among other stimuli.

We've been working with NASA GeneLab and [Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium to make life science data accessible to teachers and citizen scientists](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fspacebiology.carthage.edu%2Fgrade-6-12-educators\&sa=D\&sntz=1\&usg=AOvVaw1oAHRsf8VsXWklQu3ATS0-). This work was made possible by collaborators at the NSF CyVerse Cloud Computing infrastructure, the JPL interplanetary protection team, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and Qlik. The AstroBotany team's international presence has grown linking researchers, educators and students in the US, Japan and the UK. Our goal is to use the excitement of space exploration to train the next generation of citizen scientist to tackle any challenges that may arise in the future.
