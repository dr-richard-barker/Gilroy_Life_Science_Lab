## Investigative Insights on Plant Gene Responses to systemic stress signals

The Gilroy lab are interested in how plants sense and respond to their environment and how these signals regulate plant development. The research emphasis of the lab is to try and understand these processes at the cellular level. We combine advanced microscopy approaches such as confocal microscopy with biochemistry and molecular biology to address a wide range of biological questions:

1. How do plants sense and respond to abiotic stresses?
2. How do roots and shoots sense and respond to gravity and touch stimuli?
3. How do plants regulate growth?
4. How do plants respond to the spaceflight environment?

#### Understanding the Role of Calcium Waves in Plant Defense Mechanisms

The significance of recognizing that calcium waves act as a fundamental signal in response to a wide variety of environmental stimuli cannot be overstated. This revelation not only deepens our comprehension of plant defense strategies but also paves the way for further exploration into the intricate signal transduction pathways that regulate plant reactions to environmental stress. Recent scientific studies have shed light on the sophisticated signaling systems within _Arabidopsis_ plants, with a particular focus on the neurotransmitter glutamate's role in systemic long-distance signaling. It has been observed that introducing glutamate to these plants initiates an extensive activation of their systemic signaling pathways. This has been demonstrated through the use of advanced fluorescence time-lapse photography, showcasing _Arabidopsis_ plantsâ€™ responses to physical injury and revealing the transmission of a long-distance calcium wave throughout the plant. This crucial signal is instrumental in activating the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, which in turn triggers a series of systemic defense mechanisms intended to safeguard the plant against further damage.

#### Impact of Reduced Oxygen Availability on Plant Survivability

Reduced oxygen availability, also known as hypoxia, significantly impacts plant survivability. This condition can arise from both internal and external factors. Internally, plants may experience low oxygen environments within dense tissues, largely due to high metabolic activities. Externally, reduced oxygen can result from soil compaction, flooding, ice encasement, or waterlogging. These conditions are often aggravated by agricultural practices, leading to further oxygen depletion. Such abiotic stressors are major contributors to compromised plant health and growth.

#### Harnessing TOAST Database for Collaborative Research

Our research focuses on uncovering the initial triggers and mechanisms that guide plant responses to reduced oxygen availability. By leveraging state-of-the-art computer-based imaging techniques alongside molecular genetics, our goal is to map out how low oxygen levels influence key signaling pathways including those involving calcium ions (Ca2+), pH variations, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ATP/ADP dynamics across different times and spaces. To survive under extreme stress, cells must expertly combine oxygen detection with rapid response mechanisms. This crucial partnership helps manage a looming energy shortage and kickstarts necessary adjustments for ongoing survival. While there are exceptions, our understanding of this complex sensory and response system, especially in terms of cellular signaling, is still not fully fleshed out.

The incorporation of the TOAST database into collaborative research efforts represents a groundbreaking advancement, facilitating the involvement of citizen scientists in investigating gene responses under various conditions, notably the challenges encountered in spaceflight. This strategy notably advances the objectives of the Gilroy Lab, aiming to enhance our understanding of plant genetics and their interactions with the environment. Leveraging bioinformatics and transcriptional profiling, we focus on identifying mutants with enhanced resistance to anoxia. Interestingly, the genes spotlighted through our research are also key players in mitigating other agricultural stressors, including pathogenic infections and saline accumulation.

### Focus Area: Molecular Techniques in Genetically Modified _Arabidopsis_ Plants

At the Gilroy Lab, our expertise lies in leveraging molecular techniques to study genetically modified _Arabidopsis_ plants. Our primary research objective is to unravel the complexities of gene-environment interactions by meticulously observing phenotypes. The Gilroy Lab is dedicated to enhancing our comprehension of the interaction between genetically modified _Arabidopsis_ plants and their environments at a genetic level. This initiative aims to bolster plant resilience and productivity through groundbreaking research. By focusing on plant responses to hypoxia and the unique stresses of spaceflight, the Gilroy Lab strives to significantly advance agricultural productivity and sustainability, focusing on improving plant resilience. This approach allows us to discern the roles specific genes play in these interactions.

#### Key Research Goals:

* **Decoding Gene Functions:** Through detailed phenotype analysis, we aim to understand the contribution of specific genes to the overall plant responses to various environmental conditions.
* **Sensitivity and Resilience to Environmental Stresses:** A major thrust of our work focuses on identifying genes that modify the plant's sensitivity or resilience to environmental stresses. This includes investigating genes that either amplify the stress response or enhance the plant's ability to withstand adverse conditions.
