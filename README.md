# Gilroy Life Science Lab

We are interested in how plants sense and respond to their environment and how these signals regulate plant development. The research emphasis of the lab is to try and understand these processes at the cellular level. We combine advanced microscopy approaches such as confocal microscopy with biochemistry and molecular biology to address a wide range of biological questions:

1. How do plants sense and respond to abiotic stresses?
2. How do roots and shoots sense and respond to gravity and touch stimuli?
3. How do plants regulate growth?
4. How do plants respond to the spaceflight environment?

#### Understanding the Role of Calcium Waves in Plant Defense Mechanisms

The significance of recognizing that calcium waves act as a fundamental signal in response to a wide variety of environmental stimuli cannot be overstated. This revelation not only deepens our comprehension of plant defense strategies but also paves the way for further exploration into the intricate signal transduction pathways that regulate plant reactions to environmental stress.

Recent scientific studies have shed light on the sophisticated signaling systems within _Arabidopsis_ plants, with a particular focus on the neurotransmitter glutamate's role in systemic long-distance signaling. It has been observed that introducing glutamate to these plants initiates an extensive activation of their systemic signaling pathways. This has been demonstrated through the use of advanced fluorescence time-lapse photography, showcasing _Arabidopsis_ plants’ responses to physical injury and revealing the transmission of a long-distance calcium wave throughout the plant. This crucial signal is instrumental in activating the jasmonic acid signaling pathway, which in turn triggers a series of systemic defense mechanisms intended to safeguard the plant against further damage.

## Investigative Insights on Plant Gene Responses to Hypoxia and Spaceflight by The Gilroy Lab

The innovative utilization of the TOAST database marks a significant leap in collaborative research efforts, particularly by fostering citizen scientists' engagement in the exploration of gene reactions to diverse conditions, including the unique challenges posed by spaceflight. This approach significantly propels the Gilroy Lab's mission to deepen our comprehension of plant genetics and their environmental interactions.

Our current endeavours are dedicated to elucidating the initial triggers and mechanisms that govern plant responses to diminished oxygen levels. By integrating advanced computer-based imaging with molecular genetics, we aim to delineate the spatial and temporal interplay between low oxygen conditions and pivotal signaling pathways such as calcium ions (Ca2+), pH levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ATP/ADP.

Furthermore, leveraging bioinformatics and transcriptional profiling, we focus on identifying mutants with enhanced resistance to anoxia. Interestingly, the genes spotlighted through our research are also key players in mitigating other agricultural stressors, including pathogenic infections and saline accumulation.

Survival under such stress conditions mandates a sophisticated integration of oxygen sensing capabilities with a swift response machinery. This synergy is crucial for managing the impending cellular energy crisis and activating necessary adaptive growth strategies for sustained survival. Notwithstanding several exceptions, our grasp of this intricate sensory/response system, particularly at the cellular signaling level, remains incomplete.

One notable abiotic stressor, the reduction in oxygen availability from various sources, significantly impacts plant survivability. The sources of hypoxia can range from dense tissue metabolic activities to external environmental conditions like soil compaction, flooding, ice encasement, or waterlogging due to agricultural practices.

Specializing in molecular techniques applied to genetically modified _Arabidopsis_ plants, the Gilroy Lab endeavors to decode the roles of specific genes through phenotype observations—reflecting the gene-environment interplay. Identifying genes that either heighten sensitivity or confer resilience to environmental stresses remains a focal point of our research.

Through these multifaceted approaches, the Gilroy Lab aspires to contribute significantly to the understanding and improvement of plant resilience to hypoxia and spaceflight-induced stresses, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.
